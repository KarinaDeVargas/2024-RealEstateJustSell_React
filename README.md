# Real Estate Website

	 
## SUMMARY
During Web Dev I we develop a real estate website as a final project. Since the website was complete and has a front end and back end well defined and well developed, Team 1 chooses to use this website as a starter to attend all Web Dev II requirements for the final project.

In this document we will introduce our ideas and first definition as requested by Gregory Prokopski.


## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Just Sell Real Estate Website is a website for a Real Estate company where all properties can be announced by the company. In this website the company can post real pictures, information about the properties and take questions from user.

The Just Sell Real Estate Website is designed to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for both registered users and real estate professionals.

Individuals who register on our site gain access to a plethora of features, including the ability to browse properties, conduct searches based on various criteria, and even make secure property purchases online. 

For realtors, the platform offers advanced functionalities. Realtors can leverage the website to showcase their property listings by posting real pictures and detailed information. The comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations enable realtors to manage their property listings.

Administrators play a crucial role in overseeing and managing the entire system. They can perform CRUD operations related to user management. This includes adding new users, modifying existing user details, and ensuring a secure and organized user database.

The website incorporates modern technologies, such as React for an interactive user interface, NodeJS/Express for robust server-side functionality, and MySQL/SequelizeJS for efficient database management. Additional libraries, including express, Cors, Nodemon, Axios, Bootstrap, Formik, and yup, enhance the development process and contribute to a feature-rich application.
